Hello.c

Extra Credit:
I implemented the command parser based on the one Daveti showed in lab lecture.

Compilation instructions:
Make works

Overview
1. Working shell
2. Shell will kill process which go over the time out
3. Shell will print messages based on success or failure of the process
4. Implemented the basic hello world system call
5. Compiled and updated the kernel
6. ran test program to show that kernel call was working

Description of code:
I have the shell code running using just a couple functions. 
The hello sys call is nothing unusual. 

Hour Required: 5-8 depending on how you want to count compile time
Effort required: Fairly minimal, I thought the assignment was pretty straight forward.
